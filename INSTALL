Change directory to where you found this file. Usually the standard procedure 
will suffice. Exceptions include Mac OSX build with Xcode, explained below. 

sh configure
make
sudo make install


A more detailed help follows.

WHAT YOU NEED
---------------------------------------------------------------
CMake version 2.6 or later installed on your system.

HOW TO INSTALL:

Linux distributions:
shell> sudo apt-get install cmake

The above works on do Debian/Ubuntu based distributions.On others, command 
line needs to be modified to e.g "yum install" on Fedora or "zypper install" 
on OpenSUSE.

OpenSolaris:
shell> pfexec pkgadd install SUNWcmake

Mac OSX:
Download and install the latest distribution from 
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
Download the .dmg image and open it.

Other Unixes:
Precompiled packages for other Unix flavors (HPUX, AIX) are available from 
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html 

Alternatively, you can build from source, source package is also available on 
CMake download page.


Compiler Tools
--------------
You will need  a working compiler and make utility on your OS. 
On Mac OSX, install Xcode tools.



BUILD 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Ensure that compiler and cmake are in PATH.
The following description assumes that current working directory 
is the source directory. 


- Generic build on Unix, using "Unix Makefiles" generator

shell>sh configure
shell>make

- Mac OSX build with Xcode
shell>cd build/
shell>cmake .. -G Xcode
shell>xcodebuild -configuration Relwithdebinfo
(alternatively, open tailserver.xcodeproj and build using the IDE)

Command line build with CMake 2.8
After creating project with cmake -G as above, issue
cmake .. --build 
this works with any  CMake generator.
^ I doubt it works at all.
