-(disappointed to find that nobody has cared enough to make any)somewhere must be tools to test on vast amount of platforms automatically.
-(don't waste time)test with 65535 and more clients sending SYN without a followup
.test with a socket file path ""
.(see below)test with a slow reader (should block stdin of tailserver), slow stdout too why not


Slow tailer test:
[terminal 1] test/fast_server.sh test.sock | pv > /dev/null
[terminal 2] socat -u UNIX-CONNECT:test.sock - | sed -n '0~10000p'
[terminal 3] socat -u UNIX-CONNECT:test.sock - | { pv -L 1 -Ss 10; pv; } > /dev/null
^ You should see [terminal 2] being blocked for a moment and then resume without data lost whereas [terminal 3] will
get disconnected for being too slow.

Slow stdout test:
[terminal 1] test/fast_server.sh test.sock | { pv -Ss 10000000; pv -L 1 -Ss 10; pv; } > /dev/null
[terminal 2] socat -u UNIX-CONNECT:test.sock - | sed -n '0~10000p'
^ You should see [terminal 2] patiently block for the 10 seconds [terminal 1] is slow.

Slow stdin test:
Wait.. what? Trivially tested by test/slow_server.sh
