   Some code is borrowed from GNU coreutils tee.c and tail.c

   tail.c: Paul Rubin, David MacKenzie, Ian Lance Taylor, Giuseppe Scrivano
   Socket handling from mysqld.cc (GPL2=)
   Note that since MySQL does not include the "or any later version" clause, the license of tailserver 
   is forced to be GPL2 by the magic of law.
