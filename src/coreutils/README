Although I've taken these files from GNU Coreutils, I've kept my rights to modify them at will, 
to simplify the interdepencency mess that Coreutils is and avoid maintenance of unused code.

What is being used is compatible with the versions that existed before 2007-07-10, with but trivial
changes from the later commits.
